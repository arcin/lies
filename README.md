# This repo is full of lies.

### Big fat lies.
Lies that were generated to show a colleague how trivial it is to alter **git history and github activity.**

If you want to lie on github, just use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcin/dotfiles/master/scripts/garden-gnome) handy dandy bash script I made.

Oh yea, you need **fortune** to get the wonderful commit messages.

```shell
brew install fortune
```
